### Competitive Programming Code
This repository contains code of all the problems I have solved from these websites:
- [codeforces.com](https://codeforces.com/) : The code is organised contest-wise in different folders.
  From each contest, the file name indicates the problem.
- [CSES Problemset](https://cses.fi/problemset/) : I have named the code files based on the problem number.
  The problem statement can be accessed at `https://cses.fi/problemset/task/<problem_number>`. (For example: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1068)

My templates are present in the `templates` folder. I hope to expand my set of templates with time.
